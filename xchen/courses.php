				I have taken courses from various subjects. I have taken all the four digital media study core courses. I also took writing and middle east dance the first semester of my freshman year. I took the two elementary Spanish courses and right now Iâ€™m taking the intermediate two Spanish. I also took elementary Turkish the second semester of my freshman year, but unfortunately the professor is leaving the university and all the Turkish language courses are canceled. This semester I am also taking resistant literature of the middle east, advanced front-end web developing, revolution in sound, and introduction to book publishing.
