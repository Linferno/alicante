			<p>
				I am a digital media study undergraduate student of University of Rochester. I am also trying to major or minor in Spanish. I am that kind of person who is not really specialized or skilled in any specific field but always willing to try something new. I am not sure if it is a good thing or a bad thing to be exploring around different possibilities and not commit myself in one particular, but that is what I am right now, at least in this stage of my life. My computer science skill includes basic HTML, CSS, python. My other skills include cooking weird food, drawing grotesque, speaking a little chin-span-glish, and chin-span-urk.
