In 2015, I came to Rochester to pursue my bachelorâ€™s degree. Started off with talking econ108 with Pr. Rizzo, I soon gain great interest in the field of economics because he made the class interesting and easy to understand. After taking more courses with him, I declared my major as Financial Economics at the end of the sophomore year. At that time, I think economics will be my greatest passion in the future.

	For the summer of my sophomore year, I applied for an internship at an asset management company in Shanghai. As I started as an equity research intern in this company, I learned multiple ways to analysis a company and its stock price to see if they are worthy to invest. On the other hand, I have gained interest on business analyst from many internal meetings, that is to use big data and programming to predict future movement of stocks. After I did more research on business analyst, and taking some classes in it, I decided to switch my major into business analyst.
