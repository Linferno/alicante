	In 2012, I came to the states at 16 years old as an exchange student in Williamsburg. Living in Shanghai for my entire live, I have never left my family for longer than a week. So, coming to a totally different country and study excites me and frighten me at the same time. The culture shock really gets to me the first few weeks, but after that my study live here just gets better and better with the help of friendly classmates and my host parents.

	For the three years in Walsingham Academy, one thing that help me the most are being part of the tennis team. I did not know how to play when I first started, and my English wasnâ€™t good enough to let me communicate with others. That depressed my quite a bit because I can only watch my teammates play on matches while I sit on the bench. Weeks later, with the help of my coach, I finally get the hang of it and my language and social skills improved with my tennis skills.  With the confidence I gained from success in tennis, I graduated with honor and got accepted into University of Rochester.
