	<p>Throughout high school I would work as a part-time tennis coach, though mostly had very light hours (about 4-5 hours a week). The hours were fairly flexible and I could pick up lessons whenever my local tennis club was teaching them, allowing me to change my schedule regularly as needed. At the time I was on the varsity tennis team so the only prerequisite I needed was to be able to play and have the patience to deal with children aged anywhere from 6-14. This was my first job I received on my own as well, which was different but educational for a 15-year-old me. Over the summer, I also taught at the summer camp which was a lot more demanding, as the hours would often be, besides for certain exceptions, 9am-4pm.

	I have also worked as a warehouse employee for my dad, I would often be moving and packaging boxes and/or searching for items that needed to be shipped in the warehouse in order to package. Although it was not the most entertaining job in the world, I learned a lot about my dad's company and would be able to spend a lot of time working with my siblings along with my dad.
