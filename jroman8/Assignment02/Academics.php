	<p>As far as my academic career used to be, I was very into biology in high school. I would attend science competitions and fairs to present research I had begun through a special science research program in my school (which I credit my acceptance to the University of Rochester to). Since I was still a teenager, I had not really explored many fields up to this point and although the idea of biology excited me, I do not believe I was truly passionate about it. I had always been into video games and technology since I was old enough to operate a screen, so it seemed logical that I would like computer science, but my school did not offer anything in the field, so I entered the University of Rochester with a major in biology. Once I arrived at college, I continued with my track for a year or two before I began taking classes in computer science and instantly fell in love with it. I did not realize how much I would truly enjoy the field but I am extremely happy I will end up being able to complete my major within the 4 years even with some extra classes from other fields under my belt.</p>
