			<p>
				Xinyi is a digital media study undergraduate student of University of Rochester. She is also trying to major or minor in Spanish. She is a person who is not really specialized or skilled in any specific field but always willing to try something new. Xinyi is not sure if it is a good idea exploring around different possibilities and not commit herself in one particular subject, but she understands this is what college is for. Her computer science skill includes basic HTML, CSS, python. Her hobbies include cooking weird food, drawing grotesque, speaking a little chin-span-glish, and chin-span-urk.

			<h2>Personal:</h2>

				<p>
					Xinyi has been living in Beijing, the capital of China for the past 15 years and this is her first years living in U.S. Her primary language is Chinese, but the first language she learned was Cantonese, even though she already forget everything. Beijing is a gigantic city full of spectaculars. You can see the relic of the ancient empire standing in between metropolitan skyscrapers. You can taste authentic local food from all over the China, since 70% of the population is originally from the outside of Beijing. Growing up in Beijing, she was deeply influenced by its environment - unsettled, always craving for change and refinement, and open to new ideas.

            <h2>Jobs:</h2>

				<p>
					Rochester is a peaceful, nice small town for Xinyi, even though her former roommate from upstate New York told her it is actually a “city”. She did manage to some jobs to do by fortune. Currently, Xinyi is working as a teaching assistant in CSC170, and a note-taker in AME294 this semester. She never had a job here before in the U.S. In Beijing, she used to teach and took care kids from high school and primary school. She never had a job which is not related to education, though she really wants to become a coffee shop owner deeply inside her heart. She believes every job merits equally, regardless how many people you serve, what you do, how many dollars float. Because what really matters is that she gains a sense of achievement and respect herself.
