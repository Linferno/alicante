		<p>
			Renjie is an international student currently major in Business Analytics and minor in Computer Science at the University of Rochester. Before that, he completed his high school at Walsingham Academy in a little town named Williamsburg. He has lived and studied in Shanghai, China for 16 years.

	<h2>Personal:</h2>

		<p>
			In 2012, he came to the states at 16 years old as an exchange student in Williamsburg. Living in Shanghai for his entire live, he has never left his family for longer than a week. So, coming to a totally different country and study excited and frighten him at the same time. The culture shock really got to him the first few weeks, but gradually he adjusted into the American culture with the help of friendly classmates and his host parents.
		</p>

		<p>
			For the three years in Walsingham Academy, one thing that help him the most was being part of the tennis team. He did not know how to play when he first started, and his English wasn’t good enough to let him communicate with others. That depressed him quite a bit because he can only watch my teammates play on matches while he sat on the bench. Weeks later, with the help of his coach, he finally got the hang of it and his social skills improved with his tennis skills.  With the confidence he gained from success in tennis, graduated with honor and got accepted into University of Rochester.

	<h2>Jobs:</h2>

		<p>
			For the summer of his sophomore year, he applied for an internship at an asset management company in Shanghai. As he started as an equity research intern in this company, he learned multiple ways to analyze a company and its stock price to see if they are worthy to invest. On the other hand, he has gained interest on business analyst from many internal meetings, which is to use big data and programming to predict future movement of stocks. After he did more research on business analyst, and taking some classes in it, he decided to switch his major into business analyst.
		</p>

	<h2>Academics:</h2>

		<p>
			In 2015, he came to Rochester to pursue his bachelor’s degree. Started off the college academics taking ECO 108 with Pr. Rizzo, Renjie soon gained great interest in the field of economics because he made the class interesting and easy to understand. After taking more courses with him, he declared his major as Financial Economics at the end of the sophomore year. At that time, he thought economics will be his greatest passion in the future.
		</p>

		<p>
			Besides the normal programming classes, he has also found interest in website design after taking CSC170, which was an awesome course to introduce the world of web design.  During this class, he has learned so much about HTML, CSS and JS. He also learned how to put these components together and make them as a workable website. After that, he decided to add computer science as his minor and continue to build up more knowledge about web design by taking more advanced classes such as csc174.
