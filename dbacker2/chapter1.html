	<h2>Chapter 1: The Highschool Years</h2>

	<p> I actually didn’t really consider myself doing anything related to digital media until as recently as sophomore year of college. I attended the High School of American Studies in the Bronx, which didn’t offer any media or computer classes. My favorite subjects were English and U.S. History, because I liked to read stories and write about them. HSAS taught me how to deliver, either through speaking or writing, a well defined argument. </p>
