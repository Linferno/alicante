	<h2>Chapter 3: Sophomore Year Year</h2>

	<p>So what else could I do instead. Well, after realizing economics wasnâ€™t for me I decided to take a wide variety of classes during sophomore and see which ones interested me the most. Of these, my absolute favorite was Writing in a Digital World. This class combined my interest in writing with my fascination of human engagement with media. The class taught me how to write specifically for an internet audience which, after mostly writing research papers or class essays, was really refreshing fun to consider. I decided to take DMS 104 the following semester to confirm my interest in the field. The class was all about conceiving of, researching, and designing some sort of digital product. Here too, much of the class focused on designing products for a specific audience in mind, combining creativity and pragmatism to make something useful. By the end of sophomore year, I decided to pursue a degree in Digital Media Studies.
