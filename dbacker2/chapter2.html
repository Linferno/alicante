	<h2>Chapter 2: Freshman Year</h2>

	<p>Despite my preferences in high school, I knew I didn’t want to be a history or an English major in college, mostly because I didn’t think I would get a job with these degrees. Thus, when I actually showed up to the University of Rochester, the first subject I tried to study was economics. Economics was something I was turned onto through looking at metagames. A metagame is like the game equivalent of a marketplace, and is comprised of everything that everyone knows about the game. For example, let’s say that rock is very popular, so more players begin to use paper in response. That would be example of a metagame, where rock is popular so the metagame shifts to paper being stronger. When I got to U of R, I figured that I could carry my interest in metagames over to the field of economics. That’s when I realized that studying economics required me to do math. I don’t like math, so that didn’t work out.  </p>
